This is the solution of the problem given by myta business solutions.

The backend which includes authentication and data fetching from json api is done by node.

The frontend of this app is done using react and redux.

The authentication part is done using jwt(java web tokens).


////First the node modules have to be installed with the help of the command npm install for both backend and frontend.

////To start the frontend the command in the terminal is npm start.

////To start the backend server the command in the terminal is node app.js
